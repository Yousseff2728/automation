# Automation Stuff

Here, you will find my playground with different network-related automation scripts to make my life easier. Nothing here is actually worthy of production use, so tread *carefully*.

## Current Projects:

### Cisco IPSec tunnel Creation

Run the `ipsec.py` program to create an IPSec tunnel used on Cisco ASA devices.

####Shit that don' work:
IKEv2 functionallity not fully built

IKEv1 functionality is suspect at best

Error handling is sketchy
