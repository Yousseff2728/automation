# Automation Stuff

Here, you will find my playground with different network-related automation scripts to make my life easier. Most of the items in this repo are not worthy of production use, so tread *carefully*.

## Network Projects

Please note that all working scripts are in the `/completed` folder.

### Cisco IPSec tunnel Creation

Run the `ipsec.py` program to create an IPSec tunnel used on Cisco ASA devices. The "ipsecExample.CSV" will allow you to enter the informaiton into a form.

### Quick object creation for ASA

Run the `quickObject.py` program to create network-objects from a CSV.

## Terraform Projects

### AWS Terraform

I have a very basic AWS build leveraging Terraform. You'll need to make your own ".tfvars" file to use it (obviously b/c im not letting you use my credentials!)
